Thought Process
So what i basically figured out that the task involves controlling a Sabertooth 2x60 motor driver using data from an RC transmitter, with the data transmitted via an SBUS receiver module. The goal is to interpret the SBUS data, perform interpolation to convert the channel values into a format suitable for the Sabertooth motor driver, and then control the motor accordingly.
When I first tackled this task, I needed to get a good grasp of the problem: controlling a Sabertooth motor driver with data from an RC transmitter using an SBUS receiver. My approach was to break it down into manageable steps:

Understand the Data: I started by figuring out how the SBUS data was structured and how to extract the 11-bit channel values from it. This meant getting familiar with bitwise operations to decode the data correctly.

Map the Values: Next, I needed to convert these channel values into a format the Sabertooth motor driver could use. Since the motor driver expects PWM values in a specific range, I mapped the 11-bit values to this range using linear interpolation.

Handle Serial Communication: I wrote functions to manage reading from the SBUS receiver and writing to the Sabertooth driver. This involved handling files for serial communication and ensuring the data was transferred correctly.

Test Everything: Once the code was in place, I compiled it and tested it with sample data to make sure everything worked as expected. I used comparisons to check if the output matched the expected results.

Debug and Refine: During testing, I ran into some issues, so I debugged and made adjustments as needed to get everything running smoothly.

By breaking the problem into these steps and focusing on each part, I was able to develop a working solution and prepare it for submission.

so this is the exactly how i tackled the problem using the above prompt from chatgpt and it explained me how to approach the problem and then proceed with the code and implementation.
